            <p>
              <p>It's hard to get along with people with my particular version of Autism. Non-verbalism is not easy to move out and the amount of patience I've had to engage just to endure other people's temperaments is, well. Hard to describe here; not because I can't but because I don't want you to empathize with my negative experiences. Instead I'd like to help you understand the constructive value of being a stone-faced autistic person and cultivate ethical incentives in an organization.</p>
<p>Typically people in power need to orient their communication into demanding higher standards and the unfortunate truth about my particular flavor of autism, accurately portrayed by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddea_Graham">Thaddea Graham</a> in her role in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Education_(TV_series)">Sex Education</a>. There isn't much room for conversation on my end because the feelings I have around something going wrong are well, intense. The slightest mistake I make could be ballooned into a false reality and the unfortunate truth, a majority of people I've been around have zero issue reinforcing what I say rather than what I do and that further limits my behavior to a very narrow interaction to get things done. As the professional environments I've found myself within have cultivated and attempted to reinforce masking behaviors and I have to actively put a stop to it in delicate and diplomatic ways.</p>
<p>Someone was reckless enough to sit in the same room with me and talk to me about my Autism. He was encouraged to do it and this particular individual is someone who is normally kind, but also mentally unstable. My attempts to stabalize the relationship were well, ignored because he was put in a position of power and felt as if he had some kind of authority over me. I side stepped his advances and tried to help him understand the fallacy of his behavioism. However, in the end he chose to cross a series of boundaries and verbally assault me serval times. Not because he felt justified to do it, but because an authority figure gave him permission to do it. These people exist and as much as I live up to a golden standard beyond-reproach when it comes to being autistic, there is always someone ready to justify they know more than I do about autism without actually having a conversation with me.</p>
<p>Normally called scapegoating.</p>
<p>He had recently put his child through ABA therapy and me knowing the landscape of Autism. I knew having a conversation with him about the negative effects of ABA therapy are, well, probably unwelcome because he's already in a desperate situation with his child and I don't want to get tangled into that emotional mess with him. As much as I feel for his child and the path he is forcing his child to undertake, I couldn't help but empathize with his plight of his belief systems that he's a functioning individual. In reality, he showed all the same signs as someone who is trying to function in a world where he too, has a variation of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/ptsd-autism">PTSD</a>. Indoctrinated into the belief system of power and the illusion of comfort it provides.</p>
<p>This is where my version of Autism makes it hard to progress in life, because as I consider myself an advocate for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality#Feminist_thought">intersectionality</a>. Most people look at me as a white-privileged male first and the conversation of equal rights or gender identity doesn't come up. I'm forced into a behavior pattern which limits my communication to precise and pine-pointed comments.</p>
<p>Executives are hard to converse with because they have to remain engaged and focused in a field of variables that cultivate nuero-colonialism relevant behaviorism. I take great care to maintain their integrity because their reputations are earned over a series of events that have brought them the grace of good fortune as they've navigated the ethical landscape yet to be influenced my more relevant narrative about autism. This is where my version of autism makes it hard to navigate relationships on that level. I have to learn and respond to their <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_(linguistics)">intonation</a> because they speak relative to a team that is inundated with nuero-colonialism. If I introduce an ethical dilemma they can't navigate, then the most likely course is for me to be terminated and the sad truth is. The ABA narrative is at the forefront of their current understanding. I perceive <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_in_autism">"The War on Autism"</a> is based on a similar narrative from <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_drugs">The War on Drugs</a> and has been framed into some of their minds and a lot of my peers.</p>
<p>Enlightenment is not enough; fortitude in a society of people educated with the wrong narratives makes things just a little bit harder for all of us us. It is easy for people to pin behavior on those they disagree with. This is nuero-coloniasm at it's worst, as it demonizes the behavior of another and reinforces the negative affects of behaviorism as a standard to live up to within a social group. Authority figure after authority figure using other people as example on how individuals should behave or should not behave. Not taking into account merits and integrity I breath every day by simply walking into the door and not upsetting the natural balance to their ideologies and maintaining order within myself without suffering from mental illness is a story I've just begun to start telling you.</p>
<p>There is hope, the reality is, every single person on this planet is good. Even the worst of the worst of us, are good; science is starting to discover all the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8">reasons as to why someone might go bad</a>. The sad truth is, people who can't function need to be cut from the group in order to prevent the group from imploding and that was the group I would most commonly be shoved into and the immense amount of effort I went through to become self-aware of that was.. well, painful. Literally, the depth of it all was near impossible to contain as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YuYuHakusho/comments/17zp163/what_exactly_is_genkais_spirit_orb/">I felt pain of the spirit-orb(dramatic-metaphor) tear at me from within</a> emotionally, ethically, reputationally, physically, violently. It wasn't easy to overcome, let's go with that. I wish that version of pain on nobody else, not even an enemy.</p>
<p>My non-verbalism took root in me before I became a teenager. Visiting and asking my kindergarten teacher why I wasn't allowed to be a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_safety_patrol">safety patrol officer</a>. At the time, her response was complete and utter shock because I was confused as to why she looked at me that way. Searching deep within myself today, the most relevant answer is that I don't think she was aware that I had an intelligence underneath my <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/masking">Autistic Mask</a>. Furthermore the concept of an Autistic Mask wasn't to be published for at least twenty years after I had asked her that question. In my early twenties, a series of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://neuroclastic.com/aba-strategies/">behavior manipulation techniques</a> was used to force me into a group of people that would come to hate me and it was my first social experience outside of school. It was absolutely traumatizing and produced trauma in me that I was able to measure and review using an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.openbci.com/AddOns/Headwear/MarkIV/">OpenBCI Ultracortex Mark IV</a> decades later. I managed to recover from the trauma using a therapy I developed, but at significate cost of 20 years flopping around between jobs and with the constant feeling of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iO0wu9vyOU">trying to be</a> more than what I am. Naturally I was ecstatic at what I discovered. Physical, verifiable evidence, that what I experienced is producing physical changes. ..why did it take me that long to learn how to undo the damage that was done to me?</p>
<p>The attempt to fix me in my early twenties is what broke me. Score one for ABA as it silenced me and pushed me into a pipeline that was suppose to improve my quality of life. In the end, I came full circle with the feelings and challenged the status quo after learning enough about myself. Before I learned what the Autistic Mask is, I was already well aware of it. I knew something was off with my ability to interact with people, because I found myself in conversations meaning to say one thing and then completely saying other things. It didn't take me long to trace the origin of the misalignment from my early twenties and me not having access to those memories.. I had to develop an elaborate emotional map of every relationship I had with the newly minted emotional chassis I had been developing in secret for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Gifted with the concept of agency in a form of innocence I hadn't seen before. I started to build-out my emotional chassis back in 2010 for the first time. The amount of effort it took to assert my inner-self over your Autistic Mask is intangible and I see other autistic people suffering with the same tug of war. I believe our inability to harmonize our Autistic Mask with our inner-selves is the primary reason why we have <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/autistic-burnout">burnouts</a>.</p>
<p>The amount of false starts I had and burnouts I went through to find some kind of way to function; is/was maddening. In time, it became clear to the that the only way I could maintain is if I typed and wrote code and practiced decision making around my computer as it became my agent of creation and the mountain of software I've built both <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jbcurtin/">open-source</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_source">closed-sourced</a> no longer held value to me outside of the people it helped. I eventually gravitated towards an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ">altruistic</a> belief system that allowed me to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vairagya">walk away from a project without attachment</a> and gifted me a sense of disentanglement. One of the first metrics I used to identify good executives from bad executives, executives more interested in the building a relationship with you vs executives more interested in the code you're writing for them.</p>
<p>With enough of the core of my emotional chassis built and a rudimentary ethical matrix installed in my reasoning. I was now making emotional decisions without showing a hint of emotion. Scientists are looking for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1091740">visual/facial indications</a> of emotional response in Autistic children passing as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/zjkw3n/comment/izwyoeb/">allistic</a>. Which is great that we're talking about it, but the writing of the science is already biased as it passively emphasizes the importance of showing an emotional response.. which is another example of nuero-colonialism.</p>
<p>How would you start the conversation with an authority figure with the intention to dispel the negative effects of behaviorism?</p>
